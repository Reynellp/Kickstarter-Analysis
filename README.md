# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
 - How different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
 - Visualization of data provided 
### Purpose
 - Provide visual outcomes based on the launch date and goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
 - Created a table that filters down to two categories to pinpoint the outcomes of launch dates (Parent category,Years).
 - No challanges while creating the PIVOT table and graph. 
 - 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 - Based on the data provided the most successful month to lauch is May.  With keeping in mind your total success rate throughtout the months is an average of 61%. It is safe to launch with the months above 61% which are Feb(63%), Apr(63%), May(67%), Jun(65%), Jul(63%).
 - We also have months that match your average success rate of 61% which are March, September and November.
 - The month with the highest number of failures is October however, looking at the overall success rate the month of December has the lowest at 49%. The months that produceed success percentage lower than your average are Jan(58%), Aug(59%), Oct(57%) and Dec(49%)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 - Based on the data provided the goals with the range of $0 through $4999 has a success rate above 70% with the largest amount of 720 Projects. We also have the goal range of $35000 through $44999 that have a success rate of 67% however the sample size is signaficantly lower with 9 projects. The average success rate based on the projects is 66% the goals of $0 through $24999 and $35000 through $44999 are above the average success rate.   
 - The goal of $45000 through $49999 has a 100% failure rate however it only has 1 project. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Creating the graph to match the visual on challange one module. This was a result of incorrectly formating the less than and greater than sign. After reviewing the formula I was able to adjust correctly. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. You would want to launch on the months of February, April, May, June and July. 
2. Avoid launching in January, August, October and December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Goals of $0 through $4999 and $35000 through $44999 are more likely to succeed
2. Goals of $25000 through $34999 and $45000 or more are more likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Understanding the profit margins per month
2. Understanding the reason the Jan, Aug, Oct and December have the lowest success rate.
3. Knowing the demographics can help understand the average amount of donation.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. For Outcomes based on launch date another grade was created to show the success and failure percentage per month. 
2. Two pie charts created to visual show the greatest total amount of success and failure based on the average.
